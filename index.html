             I am <b>Joshua Paulo Abellanosa</b>, a         19-year-old with an insatiable curiosity and a strong desire for personal growth. Born on <b>February 3, 2004</b>, I find joy in exploring the world around me and discovering new opportunities for learning. <br>

            Being the <b>eldest</b> of <b>three siblings</b>, I hold a sense of responsibility towards my younger sister and brother. This familial connection has <b>shaped my values and nurtured a caring nature within me.</b> <br>
            
            My interests are <b>diverse</b>, ranging from <b>technology</b> and <b>science</b> to <b>creative arts</b>. This wide range allows me to approach challenges from different angles and fosters my adaptability in various situations. I thrive on pushing my limits and embracing challenges as opportunities for growth. <br>
            
            Beyond academics, I'm an adventurer at heart. Seeking out <b>new experiences</b> and stepping out of my <b>comfort zone</b> is where I truly find myself. Giving back to the community is essential to me, and I frequently engage in volunteer work to make a positive impact. <br>
